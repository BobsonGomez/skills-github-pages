Oooh, Harambe (Harambe)

We miss you

We want you to come back

Oooh, Harambe (Harambe) (Harambe)

You were so big and strong

And ever since you're gone (I can't sleep)

Life just ain't the same without you

Without you (without you)

When I woke up on the 28th of May

I looked at the TV with tears running down my cheeks

Oooh, I miss you, Harambe

I wish they took that mother's life instead

Uh, Harambe, Harambe (Harambe, Harambe)

I miss you (Harambe)

Harambe, why did you go?

Harambe, Harambe (Harambe)

I want you to come back

Is that so much to ask?

Harambe (Harambe)
